Viewport settings for various Amiga demos for use in FS-UAE.

Contributions / fixes / ideas welcome.

### Global fs-uae-launcher Options

The following are what I use in the Advanced section of the fs-uar-launcher.

Tweak to suit your preference, but these work well for a 1080p display.

```
bezel = 0
border = 0
crop = 0
fullscreen_height = 1080
fullscreen_width = 1920
line_doubling = 1
log_autoscale = 0
quick_settings = 1
scale = 1
scanlines = 0
smoothing = 0
```

Any of these can be overridden in the Custom per-demo config section (cog icon).
